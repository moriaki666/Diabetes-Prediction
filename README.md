# Diabetes-Prediction
Seminar Information Systems

Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic and widespread disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Diabetes patients are much more likely to develop further medical conditions affecting their heart, kidney, eyes, and nerves. Diabetes is mostly incurable and the only way to prevent is through early detection. That is where machine learning and healthcare analytics come into play. Traditional machine learning methods like random forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are widely used in the field of diabetes prediction. The PIMA Indian diabetes dataset was used to test three machine learning models namely random forest, Support Vector Machine, and logistic regression. Logistic regression shows similar performance to random forest and SVM due to the structure and size of the chosen dataset. Random forest has the overall best performance out of the three models. Results show that machine learning can be very effective for diabetes prediction. However, there are no notable applications of machine learning in healthcare analytics for diabetes prediction. The three main reasons behind this are briefly explored in this paper.
